## Week 1 of 2024 : Week to restore routine

![Screenshot from 2023-03-01 12-21-47](https://github.com/jeenogeorge/jeenogeorge.github.io/assets/93189890/d8652270-5ecf-46ec-abb4-60e4d28aded4)

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some R Code

```R
library(haven)
data <- read_dta('/home/jeeno/Downloads/shrug-secc-cons-rural-dta/secc_cons_rural_pc11subdist.dta')
class(data)
dim(data)
head(data)
View(data)
table <- as.data.frame(data)
class(table)
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
