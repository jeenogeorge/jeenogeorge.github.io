## Week 1 of 2024 : Week to restore routine

The year did not start with a bang. I did not want it to. I wanted it to as planned out as possible.

#### Some R Code

```R
library(haven)
data <- read_dta('/home/jeeno/Downloads/shrug-secc-cons-rural-dta/secc_cons_rural_pc11subdist.dta')
class(data)
dim(data)
head(data)
View(data)
table <- as.data.frame(data)
class(table)
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
