## Week 3 of 2024 : A Week still in limbo

The week still does not lead to something concrete.
The aim is to publish something on LinkedIn every week or, best, every day (500-word post).
I am starting a new project to explore the case of Thiruvanthpuram, where I spent most of my formative years.
Why not use my interest in geospatial science to understand the changes there?
