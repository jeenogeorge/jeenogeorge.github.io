# Losses and Damages for Building Climate Resilience
As highlighted in COP28, the data on damage and losses is crucial for understanding a disaster's full impact and assessing the effectiveness of the disaster management cycle. 

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) has made significant strides. The authority has developed a Flood Response Information Management System (FRIMS), which serves as a valuable resource for disaster risk management in the state. The system collects and publishes data on various damages due to floods, including damage to infrastructure and people, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the disaster's impact. 

One can utilize the FRIMS data, flood hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data to measure the impact of floods . 
One can further use the data to measure the efficiency of public funding for flood disaster management, defined as the avoided damages per public procurement funds for flood-related works. Such exercises will provide better insights into disaster planning, response and management and help identify spatial or administrative units that can serve as good use cases.

Effective management of disasters requires a comprehensive understanding of the disaster's impact, which can only be achieved with accurate and comprehensive data. The ongoing efforts of many state disaster management authorities, such as ASDMA, are commendable and serve as a model for other disaster management authorities.
